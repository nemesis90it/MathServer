/**
 * An Euclidean vector is a geometric object that has both a magnitude/length and a direction.
 * The mathematical structure of a collection of vectors is a {@linkplain HilbertSpace Hilbert space}.
 * This interface is made minimal to avoid listing all possible vector operations.
 * Instead, vector operations are grouped into packages and classes by their properties.
 * This is to avoid interface "pollution", lengthy and cumbersome design.
 * <p/>
 * The <em>only</em> way to change a vector is by {@link #set(int, double)}.
 * Other operations that "change" the vector actually creates a new and independent copy.

 * This implements a moving average filter with these properties:
 * 1) both past and future observations are used in smoothing;
 * 2) the head is prepended with the first element in the inputs (x_t = x_1 for t &lt; 1);
 * 3) the tail is appended with the last element in the inputs (x_t = x_n for t &gt; n).
 * When the filter length is even, more of the filter is forward in time than backward.
 * Note that both past as well as future values are used in generating the outputs.
 * Be cautious to use this in a forecasting model.

 * A simplex optimization algorithm, e.g., Nelderâ€“Mead, requires an initial simplex to start the search.
 * To create a simplex from an initial point, we add an increment factor to each component/direction of the point.
 * The increments are computed as a percentage of the maximal absolute value of the components of the initial point.
 * For an initial point of 0, we set the increment to 1.

/**
 * This interface represents a fitting method for estimating <i>β</i> in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM).
 *
 * <p>
 * John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn proposed an iteratively re-weighted least squares method for maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters, <i>β</i>.
 * Maximum-likelihood estimation remains popular and is the default method on many statistical computing packages.
 * Other approaches, including Bayesian approaches and least squares fits to variance stabilized responses, have been developed.

/**
 * A linear congruential generator (LCG) produces a sequence of pseudo-random numbers
 * based on a linear recurrence relation.
 * An LCG is simple to understand and implement,
 * but it should <em>not</em> be used for applications where high-quality randomness is critical.
 * The higher quality pseudo-random generators available are, for instances, {@link MersenneTwister} and {@link MWC8222}.
 * If, however, only a small number of random numbers are needed, e.g,. a few thousands,
 * then an LCG should be sufficient.

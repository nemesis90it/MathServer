/**
 * A (pseudo) random number generator is an algorithm designed to generate a sequence of numbers that lack any pattern.
 * However, it is very important to know that the sequence is not random at all and
 * that it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values.
 * Knowing the generation algorithm and the states can predict the next value, as the values are generated in a deterministic way.
 * <p/>
 * By default, an implementation of {@code RandomNumberGenerator} is
 * <em>not thread-safe</em>, and thus should not be shared among multiple threads.
 * If a {@code RandomNumberGenerator} instance is used in a multi-threaded
 * program, for example, use
 * <blockquote><code>
 * RandomNumberGenerator rng = RandomNumberGenerators.synchronizedRNG(new Gaussian());
 * </code></blockquote>

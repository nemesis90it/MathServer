/**
 * GLM for the quasi-families.
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to construct a likelihood function it is usually necessary to posit a probabilistic mechanism specifying, for a range of parameter values,
 * the probabilities of all relevant samples that might possibly have been observed.
 * Such a specification implies the knowledge of the mechanism by which the data were generated or substantial experience of similar data from previous experiments.
 * Often, this knowledge is not available.
 *
 * <p>
 * We may, however, be able to specify the range of possible response values and past experience with similar data is usually sufficient to specify,
 * in a qualitative fashion, a few additional characteristic features of the data.
 * From these characteristics, we may construct a quasi-likelihood function.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that AIC is not computed for the quasi-GLM because there is no 'real' likelihood function.

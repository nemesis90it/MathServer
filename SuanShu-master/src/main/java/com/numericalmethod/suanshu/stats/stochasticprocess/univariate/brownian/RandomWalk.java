/**
 * This is the Random Walk construction of a univariate Brownian motion.
 *
 * <p>
 * For constant μ and σ, this method is exact in the sense that
 * the joint distribution of the simulated values coincides with the joint distribution of the corresponding Brownian motion a the time grid points.
 * Please note that this says nothing about what happens between two successive grid points.
 *
 * <p>
 * For time-dependent μ and σ, this method in general introduce discretization error even at the time grid points,
 * because the increments will no longer have exactly the correct mean and variance.

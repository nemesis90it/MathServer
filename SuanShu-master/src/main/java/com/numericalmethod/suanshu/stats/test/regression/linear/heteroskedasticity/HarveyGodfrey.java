 * The Harvey-Godfrey test is used to test for heteroskedasticity in a linear regression model.
 * It tests whether the estimated variance of the residuals from a regression are dependent on the values of the independent variables (regressors).
 *
 * <p>
 * The Harvey-Godfrey test tests for conditional heteroskedasticity.
 * The test statistics is computed by regressing <em>log of squared</em> residuals from the original regression against the original regressors (plus intercept).
 * The test is a chi-squared test: the test statistic distribution is nÏ‡<sup>2</sup> with k degrees of freedom.

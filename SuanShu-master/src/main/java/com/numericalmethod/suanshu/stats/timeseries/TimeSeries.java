/**
 * A time series is a serially indexed collection of items.
 * Time series data have a natural temporal ordering.
 * This makes time series analysis distinct from other common data analysis problems that have no natural ordering of the observations.
 * A time series model will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart.
 * In addition, a time series model will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that
 * values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation represents each datum and its timestamp as a pair of value and index often called time.
 * The entries (pairs) are sorted in ascending order by the timestamps, c.f., {@link TimeSeries.Entry}.
 * A {@code TimeSeries} is immutable.
 *
 * @param <T> the timestamp type
 * @param <V> the value type
 * @param <E> TimeSeries.Entry

/**
 * SHR3 is a 3-shift-register generator with period 2^32-1.
 * It uses <i>y(n)=y(n-1)(I+L^17)(I+R^13)(I+L^5)</i>,
 * with the <i>y</i>'s viewed as binary vectors,
 * <i>L</i> the 32x32 binary matrix that shifts a vector left 1,
 * and <i>R</i> its transpose.
 * SHR3 seems to pass all tests except those related to the binary rank test,
 * since 32 successive values, as binary vectors, must be linearly independent,
 * while 32 successive truly random 32-bit integers, viewed as binary vectors, will be linearly independent only about 29% of the time.

/**
 * This class collects some diagnostics measures for the goodness of fit for an Ordinary Least Square linear regression model.
 *
 * <p>
 * DFFITS is a diagnostic meant to show how influential a point is in a statistical regression.
 * It is defined as the change ("DFFIT"), in the predicted value for a point, obtained when that point is left out of the regression, "Studentized" by dividing by the estimated standard deviation of the fit at that point.
 *
 * <p>
 * Cook's distance is a commonly used estimate of the influence of a data point.
 * Cook's distance can be used in several ways: to indicate data points that are particularly worth checking for validity; to indicate regions of the design space where it would be good to be able obtain more data points.
 *
 * <p>
 * Hadi proposed a measure of influence of the i-th observation based on the fact that influential observations are outliers in either the response variable or in the predictors, or both.

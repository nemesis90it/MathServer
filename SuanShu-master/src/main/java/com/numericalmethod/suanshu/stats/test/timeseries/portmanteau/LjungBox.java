/**
 * The Ljung–Box test (named for Greta M. Ljung and George E. P. Box) is a portmanteau test for autocorrelated errors.
 * A portmanteau test tests whether any of a group of autocorrelations of a time series are different from zero.
 *
 * <p>
 * The Ljung–Box statistic is better for all sample sizes including small ones.
 * In fact, the Ljung–Box statistic was described explicitly in the paper that lead to the use of the Box-Pierce statistic,
 * and from which the statistic takes its name.
 *
 * <p>
 * The R equivalent function is {@code Box.test}.

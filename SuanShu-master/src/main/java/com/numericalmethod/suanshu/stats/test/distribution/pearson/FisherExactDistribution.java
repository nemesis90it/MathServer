/**
 * Fisher's exact test is a statistical significance test used in the analysis of contingency tables where nextSample sizes are small.
 * It converges to Chi-square distribution for a large and well balanced nextSample.
 *
 * <p>
 * For small, sparse, or unbalanced data,
 * the exact and asymptotic p-values can be quite different and may lead to opposite conclusions concerning the hypothesis of interest.
 * In contrast the Fisher exact test is, as its name states, exact,
 * and it can therefore be used regardless of the nextSample characteristics.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It becomes difficult to calculate with large samples or well-balanced tables,
 * but fortunately these are exactly the conditions where the chi-square distribution is appropriate.

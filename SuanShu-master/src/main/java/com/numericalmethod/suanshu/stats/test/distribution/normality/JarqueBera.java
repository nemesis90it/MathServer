/**
 * The Jarque–Bera test is a goodness-of-fit measure of departure from normality, based on the sample kurtosis and skewness.
 *
 * <p>
 * The statistic JB has an asymptotic chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom and
 * can be used to test the null hypothesis that the data are from a normal distribution.
 * The null hypothesis is a joint hypothesis of the skewness being zero and the excess kurtosis being 0,
 * since samples from a normal distribution have an expected skewness of 0 and an expected excess kurtosis of 0 (which is the same as a kurtosis of 3).
 * As the definition of JB shows, any deviation from this increases the JB statistic.
 *
 * <p>
 * The R equivalent function is {@code rjb.test} in package {@code lawstat}, or  {@code jarque.bera.test} in package {@code tseries} for N > 2000.

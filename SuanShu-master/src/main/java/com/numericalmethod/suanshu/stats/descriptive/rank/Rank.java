/**
 * Rank is a relationship between a set of items such that,
 * for any two items, the first is either "ranked higher than", "ranked lower than" or "ranked equal to" the second.
 * This is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects.
 * It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking.
 * The rankings themselves are totally ordered.
 * In statistics, "ranking" refers to the data transformation in which numerical or ordinal values are replaced by their rank when the data are sorted.
 * It is important to note that ranks can sometimes have non-integer values for tied data values.
 * Thus, in one way of treating tied data values, when there is an even number of copies of the same data value,
 * the statistical rank (being the median rank of the tied data) can end in ½ or another fraction.
 * <p/>
 * The R equivalent function is {@code rank}.

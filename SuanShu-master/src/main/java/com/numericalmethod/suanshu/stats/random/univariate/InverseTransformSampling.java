/**
 * Inverse transform sampling (also known as inversion sampling, the inverse probability integral transform, the inverse transformation method, Smirnov transform, golden rule, etc.)
 * is a basic method for pseudo-random number sampling,
 * i.e. for generating sample numbers at random from any probability distribution given its cumulative distribution function.
 * This basic idea is this:
 * to generate a random variable <i>X</i> with a cumulative distribution function <i>F(x)</i> for all <i>x</i>,
 * we first sample <i>u</i> from the uniform distribution.
 * Then, <i>x = F<sup>-1</sup>(u) = Q(u)</i>.
 * This method requires that <i>F(x)</i> has a continuous density function,
 * hence, strictly increasing and its inverse well defined.

/**
 * The information criteria measure the goodness of fit of an estimated statistical model.
 * The information criteria (IC) are not tests of the model in the sense of hypothesis testing;
 * rather they are tests between models - a tool for model selection.
 * Given a data set, several competing models may be ranked according to their IC,
 * with the one having the lowest IC being the best.
 * From the IC value one may infer that e.g. the top three models are in a tie and the rest are far worse,
 * but it would be arbitrary to assign a value above which a given model is 'rejected'.
 *
 * <p>
 * Akaike's information criterion is a measure of the goodness of fit of an estimated statistical model.
 * It is grounded in the concept of entropy,
 * in effect offering a relative measure of the information lost when a given model is used to describe reality and can be said to describe the tradeoff between bias and variance in model construction,
 * or loosely speaking that of accuracy and complexity of the model.
 *
 * <p>
 * The BIC is very closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).
 * In BIC, the penalty for additional parameters is stronger than that of the AIC.

/**
 * This class solves an over-determined system of linear equations in the
 * ordinary least square sense.
 * An over-determined system, represented by
 * <blockquote><i>Ax = y</i></blockquote>
 * has more rows than columns. That is, there are more equations than unknowns.
 * One important application is linear regression, where <i>A</i> is the
 * independent factors, <i>y</i> the dependent observations.
 * The solution <i>x^</i> minimizes:
 * <blockquote><i>|Ax - y|<sub>2</sub></i></blockquote>
 * That is, <i>x^</i> is the best approximation that
 * minimizes the sum of squared differences between the data values and their
 * corresponding modeled values.
 * The approach is called "linear" least squares since the solution depends
 * linearly on the data.
 * <blockquote><i>
 * <i>x^</i> = (A<sup>t</sup>A)<sup>-1</sup>A<sup>t</sup>y,
 * </i></blockquote>
 * This implementation does not use the above formula to solve for <i>x^</i>
 * because of the numerical stability problem in computing
 * <i>A<sup>t</sup>A</i>.
 * Instead, we use an orthogonal decomposition method.

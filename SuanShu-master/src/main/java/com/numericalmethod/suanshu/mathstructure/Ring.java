 * A ring is a set <i>R</i> equipped with two binary operations called addition and multiplication:
 * <blockquote><code>+ : R × R → R</code></blockquote> and
 * <blockquote><code>· : R × R → R</code></blockquote>
 * To qualify as a ring, the set and two operations, <i>(R, +, ⋅)</i>, must satisfy the requirements known as the ring axioms.

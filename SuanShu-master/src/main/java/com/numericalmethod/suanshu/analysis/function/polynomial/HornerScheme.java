/**
 * Horner scheme is an algorithm for the efficient evaluation of polynomials in monomial form.
 * It can also be seen as a fast algorithm for dividing a polynomial by a linear polynomial with Ruffini's rule.
 * <p/>
 * The polynomial remainder theorem says:
 * <pre><i>
 * P(x) = Q(x)(x - x<sub>0</sub>) + P(x<sub>0</sub>)
 * </i></pre>
 * We thus can compute the value of a polynomial <i>P(x)</i> at <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>,
 * i.e., <i>P(x<sub>0</sub>)</i>, and at the same time the quotient <i>Q(x)</i>.

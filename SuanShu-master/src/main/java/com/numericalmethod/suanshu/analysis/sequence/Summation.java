/**
 * Summation is the operation of adding a sequence of numbers; the result is their sum or total.
 * If numbers are added sequentially from left to right, any intermediate result is a partial sum, prefix sum, or running total of the summation.
 * For a finite sequence of such elements, summation always produces a well-defined sum (possibly by virtue of the convention for empty sums).
 * Given the {@link Summation.Term}s, <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>, we have
 * \[
 * S = \sum (x_i)
 * \]
 * If a {@code threshold} is specified, the summation is treated as a convergent series.
 * The summing process stops after \(x_i < \texttt{threshold}\).
 * <p/>
 * Sample usages:
 * <pre><code>
 *      Summation series = new Summation(new Summation.Term() {
 *
 *         public double evaluate(double i) {
 *              return i;
 *          }
 *      });
 *      double sum = series.sum(1, 100);
 * </code></pre>
 * <pre><code>
 *      Summation series = new Summation(new Summation.Term() {
 *
 *          public double evaluate(double i) {
 *              return 1d / i;
 *          }
 *      }, 0.0001);
 *      double sum = series.sumToInfinity(1);

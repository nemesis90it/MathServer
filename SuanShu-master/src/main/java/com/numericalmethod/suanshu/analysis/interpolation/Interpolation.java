/**
 * Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.
 * In engineering and science, one often has a number of data points, obtained by sampling or experimentation,
 * which represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of the independent variable.
 * It is often required to interpolate (i.e. estimate) the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.

 * The Newton–Cotes formulae, also called the Newton–Cotes quadrature rules or simply Newton–Cotes rules,

 * A number of standard numerical quadrature methods are special cases of the more general Newton–Cotes formula,
 * e.g., the Trapezoidal rule ({@code rate = 2}), the Midpoint method ({@code rate = 2} and specifying {@code OPEN} formula).

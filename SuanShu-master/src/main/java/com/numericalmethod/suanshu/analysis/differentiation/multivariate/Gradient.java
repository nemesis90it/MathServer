/**
 * The gradient of a scalar field is a vector field which points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field,
 * and of which the magnitude is the greatest rate of change.
 * Mathematically, the gradient of a scalar function is a vector of size <i>n</i>,
 * where <i>n</i> is the domain dimension of <i>f</i>.
 * \[
 * \nabla{f} = {\partial f \over \partial x_1}, \dots, {\partial f \over \partial x_n}
 * \]
 * The gradient vector is computed numerically using the finite difference method, e.g., {@link FiniteDifference}.

/**
 * A finite difference (divided by a small increment) is an approximation of the derivative of a function.
 * The accuracy depends on the function to take the derivative of.
 * In general, the accuracy of central difference is the best while those of forward and backward differences are more or less the same.
 * For finite difference, the higher an order of a derivative, the less accurate it gets.
 * For example, approximating the 5-th derivative is much less accurate than approximating the 1st derivative.

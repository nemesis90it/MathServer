/**
 * The Newtonâ€“Raphson method is as follows:
 * one starts with an initial guess which is reasonably close to the true root,
 * then the function is approximated by its tangent line (which can be computed using the tools of calculus),
 * and one computes the x-intercept of this tangent line (which is easily done with elementary algebra).
 * This x-intercept will typically be a better approximation to the function's root than the original guess, and the method can be iterated.
 * It has the following properties.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The function to be solved is assumed to be continuous and smooth (1st derivative exists).
 * <li>The solution converges quadratically, when the multiplicity of the root is 1; otherwise, it is linear.
 * <li>The solution may fail to converge when the derivative is or is close to 0.
 * <li>The solution may fail to converge if the initial guess is far away from the true value.
 * </ul>
